<h1>OpenConnect</h1>
<p>OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support Cisco's <a href="http://www.cisco.com/go/asm">AnyConnect SSL VPN</a></p>

<p>It has since been ported to support several other proprietary VPN protocols:
the Juniper SSL VPN (which is now known as <a href="https://www.pulsesecure.net/products/connect-secure/">Pulse Connect Secure</a>),
the <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/features/vpn">Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect SSL VPN</a>,
the <a href="https://www.f5.com/products/big-ip-services">F5 Big-IP SSL VPN</a>,
and the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/products/vpn">Fortinet Fortigate SSL VPN</a>.</p>

<p>An openconnect VPN server (<a href="https://www.infradead.org/ocserv">ocserv</a>), which implements an improved version of the Cisco AnyConnect protocol,
has also been written.</p>

<p>OpenConnect is released under the <a href="licence.html">GNU Lesser Public License, version 2.1</a>.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Development of OpenConnect was started after a trial of the Cisco
client under Linux found it to have many deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inability to use SSL certificates from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</a> or
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS11">PKCS#11</a> smartcard, or even use a passphrase.</li>
  <li>Lack of support for Linux platforms other than i386.</li>
  <li>Lack of integration with NetworkManager on the Linux desktop.</li>
  <li>Lack of proper (RPM/DEB) packaging for Linux distributions.</li>
  <li>"Stealth" use of libraries with <tt>dlopen()</tt>, even using
      the development-only symlinks such as <tt>libz.so</tt> &#8212;
      making it hard to properly discover the dependencies which
      proper packaging would have expressed</li>
  <li>Tempfile races allowing unprivileged users to trick it into overwriting arbitrary files, as root.</li>
  <li>Unable to run as an unprivileged user, which would have reduced the severity of the above bug.</li>
  <li>Inability to audit the source code for further such "Security 101" bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, OpenConnect addresses all of the above issues, and more.
</p>

<h2>Multi-protocol support</h2>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/">vpnc</a>,
OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or associated in any way
with Cisco Systems, nor with Juniper Networks, Pulse Secure,
Palo Alto Networks, F5, or Fortinet.
It just happens to interoperate with their equipment.</p>

<p>Wherever possible, OpenConnect presents a uniform API and command-line
interface to each of these VPNs. For example,
<a href="manual.html"><tt>openconnect --force-dpd=10</tt></a>
will attempt dead peer detection every 10 seconds on every VPN that
supports it, even though the actual mechanism used may be protocol-specific.
Protocol-specific features and deficiencies are described on the
<a href="protocol.html">individual protocol pages</a>.</p>
