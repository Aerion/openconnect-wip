<h1>Fortinet SSL VPN</h1>

<p>Experimental support for <a
href="https://www.fortinet.com/products/vpn">Fortinet SSL
VPN</a> was added to OpenConnect in March 2021. It is a PPP-based
protocol using the native PPP support which was merged into the 9.00
release.</p>

<p>Fortinet mode is requested by adding <tt>--protocol=fortinet</tt>
to the command line:
<pre>
  openconnect --protocol=fortinet fortigate.example.com
</pre></p>

<p>OpenConnect does not yet support the UDP transport for Fortinet, and
will use PPP over TCP for connectivity.</p>
